# Intro to Nx

Nx is a smart, fast and extensible build system with first class monorepo support and powerful integrations.

## Philosophy

Nx shares the design philosophy with Visual Studio Code. Code is a powerful text editor, and you can be very productive
with it even if you don't install any extensions. The ecosystem of VSCode's extensions is what levels up your productivity.

Similarly, the core of Nx is generic, simple, and unobtrusive. Nx plugins, although very useful, are completely optional.
(Placeholder)
Because Nx generates the boilerplate for you, most examples use Nx plugins making it easier to demonstrate the features of Nx. The vast majority of features work without the need of plugins.

## (PlaceHolder) Why should someone care about nx? What does nx bring to the table?

> is this where we talk about this?

- think (ESBuild)[https://esbuild.github.io/] time to build graph. straight to the point of "this is what we do and
- solve"
- why do people care about monorepo tooling?
- my code is not in a monorepo, so why should I care?
- or can I even use this outside of a monorepo

## Next Steps

(placeholder) we should just give the "make new repo with nx" option as the next link. bc odds are people see "add to existing repo" and might run into edge cases/stuff we didn't expect initially. Also goal of keeping # of clicks down and getting people lost in the docs on what page they were on when learning would be a good idea
